# fully_distributed_within_core runtime build configuration
# All paths are relative to this file's directory (src/runtime/fully_distributed_within_core/)
#
# Goal: orchestration + scheduling + execution run on the AI cores themselves in
# SPMD fashion, removing AICPU from orchestration/scheduling. See the design spec:
#   docs/fully_distributed_within_core.md
#
# This tree is currently re-based on the tensormap_and_ringbuffer runtime so it
# is discoverable and compiles; it reuses TensorMap, MixedKernels/ActiveMask,
# L0TaskArgs, the pto_orchestration_api submit API, and kernel-address
# resolution. The distributed model (claim race + per-core TensorMap + private
# task ring + global completion-flag ring) is layered on incrementally per the
# spec; the AICPU is reduced to an init/teardown stub.
#
# The "orchestration" directory contains submit wrappers compiled into the
# AICore image and the standalone orchestration .so. AICPU/host no longer build
# it because orchestration replay happens on AICore. Runtime-wide host-side
# assertion support lives in runtime/assert and is linked wherever common.h is
# used.
