/**
 * fully_distributed_within_core engine — public wiring entry.
 *
 * The distributed runtime moves orchestration + scheduling + execution onto the
 * AI cores in SPMD fashion (see docs/fully_distributed_within_core.md). The
 * engine itself (per-core TensorMap, claim race over global cursors, private
 * task ring, run-ahead loop, completion-flag ring, deterministic GM output
 * heap) lives in dist_engine.cpp and is compiled into the AICPU .so so it can
 * reuse the full submit-side type set (TensorMap, MixedKernels, L0TaskArgs,
 * kernel-address resolution).
 *
 * The AICPU "stub" thread does arena setup, then calls dist_engine_register()
 * once and publishes the returned per-core entry pointer via
 * Runtime::dist.core_main_fn. Each AICore worker thread invokes that entry,
 * which directly calls the orchestration entry linked into the AICore image and
 * executes the tasks it wins.
